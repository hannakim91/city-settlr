## Abstract
Settlr is a multi-page React app built for remote/tech workers looking to find the next best city to move to. A user starts at a homepage that renders city cards they can interact with the cards in 2 ways:
- Click city name links to route to each city's details page
- Choose 2 or 3 cities to "compare" the most relevant quality of life factors to a remote worker.
